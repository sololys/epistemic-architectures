## Scope

This repository focuses on **architectural and conceptual structure**
rather than implementation.

It describes form, separation of concerns, and epistemic constraints.
It does not provide executable systems, thresholds, or decision logic.

Topics include:
- epistemic uncertainty and confidence-aware operation,
- supervisory control and governance overlays,
- finite-state supervision and graceful degradation,
- separation of governance logic from task-level optimization.

---

## Status

This repository is intentionally minimal and non-operational.

It functions as:
- an architectural index,
- a citation anchor,
- a stable reference point for future extensions.

No active development is ongoing at this stage.

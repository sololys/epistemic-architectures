Architectural notes and reference material for epistemic architectures, supervisory control, and AI governance.
# Epistemic Architectures

Architectural notes and minimal references for epistemic architectures and supervisory control in autonomous systems.

This repository serves as a stable reference point linked to the following published working paper:

**Torjusen, M. E. (2026).**  
*Epistemic Architectures: Systems That Know They Know*.  
Working paper, Zenodo.  
DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18436983

## Scope

This repository focuses on architectural and conceptual structure rather than full implementation.

Topics include:
- Epistemic uncertainty and confidence-aware operation
- Supervisory control and governance overlays
- Finite-state supervision and graceful degradation
- Separation of governance logic from task-level optimization

## Status

This repository is intentionally minimal.

It functions as:
- an architectural index
- a citation anchor
- a stable reference for future extensions

No active development is ongoing at this stage.

## Scope

This repository focuses on architectural and conceptual structure rather than full implementation.

Topics include:
- Epistemic uncertainty and confidence-aware operation
- Supervisory control and governance overlays
- Finite-state supervision and graceful degradation
- Separation of governance logic from task-level optimization

## Status

This repository is intentionally minimal.

It functions as:
- an architectural index
- a citation anchor
- a stable reference for future extensions

No active development is ongoing at this stage.
